# Patterns

This project began because I wanted to help some of the people at work learn Ruby, and I decided I could turn those lessons into a class on design patterns, implementation, and testing.
All of the patterns implemented here will be fully rdoc'd and will contain a complete set of tests using Rspec.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Patterns'
