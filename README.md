## Patterns

This project began because I wanted to help some of the people at work learn Ruby, and I decided I could turn those lessons into a class on design patterns, implementation, and testing.
All of the patterns implemented here will be fully rdoc'd and will contain a complete set of tests using Rspec.

## C Extensions

The C extensions for this project live in the /lib/extensions folder. Each .c file has instructions on how to build the extension and use it in Ruby.
